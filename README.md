# 🌧️ RainfallPrediction_AUSWeather – Final Machine Learning Project

This project is a final machine learning assignment aimed at predicting the likelihood of rainfall in Australia using real-world historical weather data. It was developed in a Jupyter Notebook environment on IBM's Cognitive Class Labs platform.

## 📊 Project Overview

The dataset contains daily weather observations from the **Australian Bureau of Meteorology**, including features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. The objective is to classify whether it will rain the next day (`RainTomorrow`), enabling better weather forecasting using machine learning.

### 🔍 Objectives:
- Explore and understand weather-related datasets
- Clean and preprocess real-world, messy data
- Engineer meaningful features for model performance
- Build and evaluate machine learning classification models
- Visualize data patterns and model performance metrics

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries:**
  - `Pandas`, `NumPy` – for data manipulation
  - `Scikit-learn` – for ML pipeline, SVM model, and tuning
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` – for data visualization

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and inconsistent entries
- Feature Encoding: One-hot encoding and label encoding for categorical variables
- Feature Scaling: Standardization using `StandardScaler`
- Model Building: Support Vector Machine (SVM) within a `Pipeline`
- Hyperparameter Tuning: `GridSearchCV` for optimal parameters
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix, and Heatmap visualization
